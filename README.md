I was working in Electronics industry untill mandatory military service happened to me... 
I lost my connections and it propelled me in the other direction.
I found out my interest in Language Modeling then I set out to learn Python coding and processing language by NLP tools and eventually data related works.
I was lucky enough to get caught up with French and Chinese language that makes me relished and gives me alot of joys to continue living:))
